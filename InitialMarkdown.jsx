## Bengali by Heart and a person learning frontend

I have had great internships in the ML domain from NIT Suratkhal and NIT Calicut. 

My favorite city is Bangalore, and my favorite state is Tamil Nadu. Here are a few reasons why I love Tamil Nadu:

1. **Rich Culture:** Tamil Nadu has a rich cultural heritage, with its classical music, dance forms like Bharatanatyam, and traditional festivals like Pongal and Navaratri.

2. **Historical Significance:** The state is home to ancient temples, such as the magnificent Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur and the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, which are marvels of architecture and spirituality.

3. **Scenic Beauty:** From the lush greenery of the Western Ghats to the serene beaches of Marina in Chennai and Kanyakumari in the southernmost tip, Tamil Nadu offers a diverse range of natural landscapes.

4. **Culinary Delights:** Tamil Nadu is famous for its delectable cuisine, including dishes like dosa, idli, sambar, and filter coffee. The flavors and spices used in Tamil cuisine are unique and tantalizing.

Additionally, I am passionate about joining Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) for the following reasons:

- **Community and Networking:** GDSC provides a platform for students to connect, learn, and collaborate with like-minded individuals who share a passion for technology and innovation.

- **Skill Development:** Being a part of GDSC offers opportunities to enhance my technical skills through workshops, hackathons, and hands-on projects mentored by industry experts.

- **Access to Resources:** GDSC offers access to Google's resources, tools, and technologies, empowering students to explore and experiment with cutting-edge technology solutions.

- **Contribution to Society:** GDSC encourages students to use technology for social impact by working on projects that address real-world challenges and contribute positively to society.

My life has been nothing but ups and downs, but I take everything in a positive way and learn from my experiences. So even if I don't get into this club, please mail my improvements to up0625@srmist.edu.in.

Hope you like my project!
